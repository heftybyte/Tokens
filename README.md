## Starting the Packager

Run `npm start` to start the React Native Packager

## Running the app

### For iOS

- Make sure you have the latest Xcode.
- If you don’t have it already, install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/), which is a native dependency manager for iOS.
- Run `pod install` from your project’s ios directory.
- Open your project’s xcworkspace file in Xcode.
- Use Xcode to build, install and run the project on your test device or simulator. (this will happen by default if you click the big “Play” button in Xcode.)
- Once it’s running, the iOS app should automatically request your JS bundle from the project you’re serving from XDE or exp

### For Android

- pen the android directory in Android Studio, then build and run the project on an Android device or a Genymotion emulator.

- Once the Android project is running, it should automatically request your development url from the packager. You can develop your project normally from here.
